          <p>
            Back in 2020, I decided to try my hand at web development and jump into programming, learning <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> â€“ a move which snowballed my intrigue of tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to now, I've been working as a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> for nearly 3 years, and have been fortunate enough to work on some exciting projects, and with some amazing people.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion for web development has only grown, and I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. I'm currently working with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to build modern, responsive and accessible web applications.
